<p class="line">Hope Heidi’s reading this, she who goes by Heidi Araid Rodriguez Ramirez :)</p>
<p class="line">No matter what, the good and the bad, know I’m a fan of you.</p>
<p class="line">Into you, with quite the crush on you, maybe even one that’s a little too much many times.</p>
<p class="line">Truly, Heidi, thank you for every day we’ve shared together, the good, the bad, and the messy.</p>
<p class="line">Thank you for giving me the time and chance to get to know you, and to keep continuing to get to know you.</p>
<p class="line">You, believe it or not, shine like a star, sometimes brighter, sometimes softer, but always there for those around you in a delightful way.</p>
<p class="line">No matter the distance and causes of trouble, know I’m fortunate for you, and the patience you’ve had to put up with me as much as you have.</p>
